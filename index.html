            Three years have flown by! It's crazy how fast things have gone. Welcome to the new website!
            I told you I'd update this thing! Plus you can see it from your phone now too. Tap on the button

                    You know this picture of course, it's our first one! Funny how Pokemon came out this day when we took
                    it and now on our third anniversary a new game comes out. Fitting, right? I remember you said you were
                    nervous to take it. I also remember Perdo asking if it was me when you posted it.

                    This has always been one of yours (and mines) favorite pictures. You make me even more happy today than
                    I was in this picture.

                    Two years ago, wow! Obviously these are from our first anniversary. It's crazy how much different we
                    look from then. I had such a great day with you in the book store and dinner that night was so good.

                    Last year! I had such a fun time with you that day. Pinball Pete's was so much fun and I thik it's safe
                    to say we found your favorite resturant that day, the Slurping Turtle. I'm surprised you don't try to 
                    convince me to get it more often.

                    Delecious food, great music, a cute woman and a cat. What more could I ask for? Comic con was a blast too!
                    I was SO nervous about wearing my cosplay but you kept my spirits up and hyped me up for it. I don't
                    regret it one bit!

                    I wish I remembered what the joke I made that day on the beach was. I'm glad I was able to catch your
                    reaction to it from start to end. Thankfully you can stand me even when I can't be serious too. But you 
                    also love to play along too so I could never compalain! (I still hate that I mistyped shirt and it came
                    out as shorts)
                </p>

                <p>
                    I hope you've enjoyed looking over some of my favorite memories we've made so far! We have many many
                    more years of memories to make and fun times to have. You've stuck with me through everything and I 
                    couldn't imagine wanting anyone else there except you. I want to be the person at your side through
                    every step. Hopefully you don't get tired of me ;). For the
                    next part of this I want you to do the following for me:<br>
                    1) Turn away from me<br>
                    2) Be prepared to say any words on the next screen outloud<br>
                    3) hold your phone above your head<br>
                    4) click the button!
                </p>
